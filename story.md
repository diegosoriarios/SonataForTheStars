The grandson goes to see his grandmother, who is sitting in the garden gazing at the stars. She recognizes him, but struggles to remember his name. The grandson, a pianist, tells his grandmother that he's having a creative block and can't seem to write a new song for his upcoming concert. His grandmother, who loves the stars and knows everything about the constellations, suggests that he should try connecting the stars to form constellations as a way to clear his mind and find inspiration.

  

  

The grandson takes his grandmother's advice and spends his time connecting stars to form constellations. As he connects more and more stars, he starts to remember stories his grandmother had told him about the stars and the constellations. He also remembers the times he spent with his grandmother stargazing when he was younger.

  

  

As the days go by, the grandson spends more time with his grandmother, listening to her stories and connecting stars. He realizes that the time spent with his grandmother is precious, and that he should cherish every moment they have together. He also realizes that the stories his grandmother tells him are a rich source of inspiration for his music.

  

  

In the end, the grandson finishes connecting all the stars in the constellations, and his aunt tells him that his grandmother has been asking for him. When he goes to see her, his grandmother seems to recognize him fully, and tells him that she's proud of him and knows that he'll be a great musician. She also tells him that the stars are a reminder that even when things seem dark and confusing, there is always a way to find light and direction.

  

  

Moved by his grandmother's words, the grandson finally finds the inspiration he needs to write a beautiful new song. He performs the song at his concert, and it is a great success. He knows that his grandmother would have been proud of him, and he feels a deep sense of gratitude and love for her.

  

  

The game ends with the grandson leaving his grandmother's house, feeling more connected to her than ever before. He knows that the memories they've shared will stay with him forever, and that the stars will always remind him of his grandmother's wisdom and love.

  

  

STORIES

  

The story of Orion: The grandmother tells her grandson about the legendary hunter, Orion, who was known for his great strength and courage. She describes how Orion was so skilled with a bow and arrow that he could hunt even the most fearsome beasts. She also tells the story of how Orion fell in love with a beautiful princess named Merope, but their love was thwarted by the gods, who placed them in the sky as stars that can never touch.

  

  

The story of Andromeda: The grandmother tells her grandson the story of Andromeda, the princess who was chained to a rock as a sacrifice to a sea monster. She describes how Andromeda's beauty was so great that it attracted the attention of Perseus, the hero who eventually slayed the monster and saved her. She also tells the story of how Andromeda was placed in the sky as a constellation, next to Perseus.

  

  

The story of Cassiopeia: The grandmother tells her grandson about Cassiopeia, the queen who was so vain that she boasted about her beauty, even comparing herself to the gods. The gods punished Cassiopeia by placing her in the sky as a constellation, but they also placed her upside down, as a reminder that arrogance and vanity can lead to downfall.

  

  

The story of the North Star: The grandmother tells her grandson about the North Star, also known as Polaris, which is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. She explains how the North Star has been used for centuries as a guide for travelers, because it always points towards the north. She also tells the story of how sailors used to navigate by the stars, and how important it was to have a reliable guide to lead them home.
